# Udagram Microservices Project 
Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend](/udacity-c3-frontend)
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 
2. [The RestAPI Feed Backend](/udacity-c3-restapi-feed), a Node-Express feed microservice.
3. [The RestAPI User Backend](/udacity-c3-restapi-user), a Node-Express user microservice.

#### Udagram microservices project, I have setup my development environment on AWS EC2 interface. Reason for doing so is I have windows home edition system and finding it challanging to do the setup for docker and kubernetes on it. Also it add a bit of additional complexity to project, but it help me to learn a lot about the AWS ecosystem and understanding about the different components. My Udagram frontend is deployed on S3 bucket and other rest apis on the EC2 interface. Please find the following steps for the project development instructions.

## Setting up Udagram Microservice Dev Environment on AWS EC2

### Dockerfile (Basics) 
a text file without any extension that contains all the commands to be executed to generate an image.
#### FROM (a Dockerfile must begin with a FROM instruction . initializes a new build stage sets the base image for subsequent instructions)
#### RUN (command to create and start containers using the current image commits the results so that the resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.)
#### WORKDIR (creates (if not exists) and set the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.)
#### COPY(copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>)
#### EXPOSE (specify the network ports of the container at runtime specify the network protocol that the port listens (TCP is the default) NOTE: EXPOSE does not actually publish the port -- it functions more as a documentation tool
#### CMD (provide defaults for an executing container if the defaults do not include an executable, you must specify an ENTRYPOINT
NOTE: there can be only one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile)

# KUBERNETES( K8s) - Installation on AWS EC2 Instance
Kubernetes (K8s) is an Apache 2.0-licensed open source Container Orchestration tool for effectively managing containerized applications.
Kubernetes can automate the deployments, maintaining a logical group of containers, and helps to scale the application services. Google started it, but many other companies like Docker, Red Hat, and VMware contributed to it. In 2016, Google transferred the IP rights to Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF. 

## Why do we need Kubernetes?
![](images/kube01.png)

The above image shows the containerized applications have the advantage of being lightweight and more comfortable to manage, as compared to Virtual Machine (VM) based deployment.  Kubernetes can help in managing containerized application in the following ways:
* Manage Containers - Self-healing such as auto-restart of a backup/replica container in case of a failure, automate the rollouts and rollbacks, configuration management of containers
* Autoscale Workloads and Load balancing - Distributing a load of network traffic to suitable container/node
* Optimal Resource Utilization - Each container has its own resource (CPU and memory) requirements. Kubernetes fits a container to the 
 most suitable Node so that the resources of the Node are utilized effectively.
* Service Discovery - Provide native methods for service discovery
* Storage orchestration - Automatically mounting the volumes to containers
* Others - Fire off jobs and scheduled cronjobs, quickly integrate and support 3rd party apps, and manage Stateless and Stateful applications

## How does Kubernetes work?
A Kubernetes deployment follows the “Master-Worker” model. We need to understand the key components before we look into the architecture diagram.

* Node - A physical or virtual machine that runs multiple containers belonging to an application.
* Cluster - A set of Master and Worker Nodes. When we deploy Kubernetes, we get a cluster, which each cluster has a minimum of one worker node. A master node is capable of managing multiple worker nodes.
* Master Node - A node that decides the pod scheduling, and pod replication. The main components of a master node are - “kube-api-server”, “kube-scheduler”, “kube-controller”.
* Worker Node - A node on which pods are scheduled and run.
* Pod - A group of tightly coupled containers with shared storage, network, and a specification for how to run the containers. All the containers in a Pod are co-located and co-scheduled. The worker node(s) hosts the pods.

![](images/kube02.png)

In the above diagram, the following elements are involved:
* kubelet - a “node agent” using which the worker node communicates with the master node. The kubelet runs on each Node.
* kube-proxy - a “node agent” using which the worker node communicates with the external world. The kube-proxy also runs on each Node.
* kube-apiserver - the frontend API that exposes the Kubernetes control plane.
* etcd - a key-value store to stores the cluster state
* kube-scheduler - a component that schedules the pods for running on the most suitable Node.
* kube-controller-manager - a component that bundles and runs controller processes. These processes concern the nodes, replication,  
 endpoints, and access management.

### Kubeone installation [https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone] - [Done]
1. It is recommended to use KubeOne for Linux users. kubeone is a CLI tool and a Go library for installing, managing, and upgrading 
   Kubernetes High-Available (HA) clusters. It can be used on any cloud provider, on-prem or bare-metal cluster.

### Task-04: One we install KubeOne and Kubectl on the AWS EC2 instance,do the following steps: 
1. Setup Credentials - Create IAM account and store the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables in your AWS 
   EC2 instance
2. Create Infrastructure - Associate the required compute resources to create the Kubernetes cluster.
3. Install Kubernetes Upon successful installation, run kubectl get nodes command. 

### What is POD?
A pod is a "logical-grouping" of tightly coupled containers (one or more) that have shared storage, a network, and a standard specification. The worker node(s) hosts one or more pods at a time. The image below shows a pod having two containers running in a host.

![](images/pod.png)

The set of containers within a pod have the following essential characteristics:
1. Share the same namespace (IP address and ports), storage, and network.
2. Can communicate within the set using localhost
3. Will always be scheduled together to run on a host node as a single entity * (co-scheduled) & (co-located). If a container is shut 
   down/added/removed, then the pod has to "restart". Here, the "pod restart" means to restart the environment the containers run in.
4. Run a single instance of the containerized application. 

* [Controller] : A Controller helps to manage multiple pods each running an individual instance of the application.
Assume there are multiple pods, each running an individual instance of the application. Such a set of identical pods is called ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet (of pods) ensures the high-availability of the services hosted inside them. ReplicaSets are created and managed by Controller.

The Controller specifies the necessary attributes and state of Pods and ReplicaSets in a .yaml configuration file, which is called Deployment. This configuration file provides declarative updates to manage Pods and ReplicaSets. The Controller can manage the situations, such as when the host (worker-node) fails, or the pod scheduling is interrupted, using the "Deployment" configuration file. In such cases, the Controller automatically replaces the pod by scheduling an identical replacement on a different node.

* [Pod Templates]: The Controller uses another .yaml configuration file called "Pod Template". It contains the pod specifications such as name, count of replicas, containers to run, port, and many other details.

### K8s Deployments
Controller specifies the necessary attributes and state of Pods and ReplicaSets in a .yaml configuration file, which is called Deployment. This configuration file provides declarative updates to create and manage Pods / ReplicaSets. We define a Deployment to:
1. Create new Pods or ReplicaSets
2. delete the existing Deployments, thereby releasing the compute resources occupied by them

A Deployment contains the details about the containers that would comprise the Pods / ReplicaSets. The figure below shows a sample deployment file in which “kind”, “replicas”, “image”, and “labels” fields are highlighted.

### Deployment Configuration Files
* kubectl apply -f backend-feed-deployment.yaml 
* kubectl apply -f backend-user-deployment.yaml 
* kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml 
* kubectl apply -f reverseproxy-deployment.yaml
* kubectl apply -f pod-example/pod.yaml
* kubectl get pod -o wide

* Labels : Labels are "tags" in the form of key/value pairs that are associated with Kubernetes objects (Deployments/Pods). Multiple 
  objects may belong to a single Label. Labeling helps to identify all the objects (and resources) associated with a particular Label   
  value (say "Production" or "Testing"). Applying a Label does not have any impact on the behavior of the underlying object. They are 
  helpful in better organizing the objects (and resources).

## K8s Service Registeration, Discovery and Autoscaling
Kubernetes has an integrated pattern for decoupling configuration from application or container. This pattern makes use of two Kubernetes components: ConfigMaps and Secrets.
### ConfigMap
Externalized data stored within kubernetes.
* Can be referenced through several different means:
* environment variable
* a command line argument (via env var) injected as a file into a volume mount. Can be created from a manifest, literals, directories, or files directly.

### Secret
* Functionally identical to a ConfigMap.
* Stored as base64 encoded content.
* Encrypted at rest within etcd (if configured!).
* Ideal for username/passwords, certificates or other sensitive information that should not be stored in a container.Can be created from 
  a manifest, literals, directories, or from files directly.

Secrets and ConfigMaps both follow key-value pair styles to store information. Both the files have .yaml extension. The main difference is that the Secrets store the values in the base64 encoded format. Secret allows us to store confidential information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. A pod can use a Secret in either of the following two ways:
* As files in a volume mounted on its containers
* Kubelet uses secrets while pulling images for the pod
* So, let us learn to encode and decode given String(s) into base64 encoding format.

### Kubernetes Services Types
There are 4 major service types:
1. ClusterIP (default)
2. NodePort
3. LoadBalancer
4. ExternalName

### Scaling a Deployment
kubectl scale deployment/user --replicas=10

# CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery)
CI/CD is one of the best practices followed in the DevOps model. 

# What is DevOps?
DevOps is the combination of industry best practices, and set of tools that improves an organization’s ability to:
* Increase the speed of software delivery.
* Increases the speed of software evolution.
* Have better reliability of the software.
* Have scalability using automation.
* Improved collaboration among teams.

### Continuous Integration means newly developed code changes of a project are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository like git.
### Continuous Delivery is the process of automating the release of the merged and validated code to a repository and finally release a production-ready build to the production environment.

# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend](/udacity-c3-frontend)
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 
2. [The RestAPI Feed Backend](/udacity-c3-restapi-feed), a Node-Express feed microservice.
3. [The RestAPI User Backend](/udacity-c3-restapi-user), a Node-Express user microservice.

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with the RestAPI backends). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman, and then the frontend should integrate.

### Installing Node and NPM
This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (NPM is included) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing Ionic Cli
The Ionic Command Line Interface is required to serve and build the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI can be found in the [Ionic Framework Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the root of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:
```bash
npm install
```
>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

### Setup Backend Node Environment
You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:
1. Initialize a new project: `npm init`
2. Install express: `npm i express --save`
3. Install typescript dependencies: `npm i ts-node-dev tslint typescript  @types/bluebird @types/express @types/node --save-dev`
4. Look at the `package.json` file from the RestAPI repo and copy the `scripts` block into the auto-generated `package.json` in this project. This will allow you to use shorthand commands like `npm run dev`


### Configure The Backend Endpoint
Ionic uses enviornment files located in `./src/enviornments/enviornment.*.ts` to load configuration variables at runtime. By default `environment.ts` is used for development and `enviornment.prod.ts` is used for produciton. The `apiHost` variable should be set to your server url either locally or in the cloud.

***
### Running the Development Server
Ionic CLI provides an easy to use development server to run and autoreload the frontend. This allows you to make quick changes and see them in real time in your browser. To run the development server, open terminal and run:

```bash
ionic serve
```

### Building the Static Frontend Files
Ionic CLI can build the frontend into static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files. These files can be uploaded to a host to be consumed by users on the web. Build artifacts are located in `./www`. To build from source, open terminal and run:
```bash
ionic build
```
